# 🤖 AI Agents Playground

Welcome to the **AI Agents Playground** – a centralized repository where I explore, build, and experiment with various AI agent architectures and frameworks.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repo is organized into folders, each containing code and documentation for different types or implementations of AI agents.

Each folder contains:
- 📄 `README.md` – Describes the purpose and functionality of the agent.
- 🧠 Code – Scripts and notebooks that implement the agent logic.
- ⚙️ Config – Any configuration files (YAML/JSON/etc.).
- 🧪 Examples – Sample input/output runs, demos, or use cases.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Explore different AI agent designs and architectures.
- Compare the performance, modularity, and adaptability of each agent.
- Provide well-structured, modular codebases for future reuse or collaboration.

## 🔧 Technologies & Frameworks

This repo may include agents built using:

- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI GPT / ChatGPT APIs**
- **LlamaIndex**
- **Autogen**
- **RAG pipelines (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **GPT Engineer-style frameworks**
- Custom logic and orchestration
